### Requirements

- *nix based operating system (macOS, Linux, WSL2)
- make
- PHP version 8.0 or higher
- Node.js version 16 or higher

If you want to start quickly, it is recommended to install the [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download). It will help you to run the project locally with using our Make commands.

### Usage

This repo can be used to scaffold a Sylius plugin. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Run `composer create-project sylius/plugin-template ProjectName`
2. Have fun creating your package.
3. If you need help creating a plugin, consider reading our <a href="https://docs.sylius.com/en/latest/plugin-development-guide/index.html">Plugin Development</a> guide.

Alternatively you can use the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create a new repository based on this template.
After that you can clone your freshly created repository and run `make configure` set up your brand-new plugin.
